  "body": "### Overview\r\nOrniscient provides an interface for visualising user grains in an Orleans cluster or meta-cluster. Grains can be filtered based on defined properties or identifiers such as GUIDs or integer keys.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nOrniscient is still in early development and requires a post 1.2 version of Orleans to use, as it relies on a PR submitted to enable the introspection of grain data.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nStop by [gitter](http://www.gitter.io/DerivcoIpswich/Orniscient) to discuss the tool.",
